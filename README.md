# Custom Theme for Godot 4
Godot, in my opinion, uses too many colors to denote different things. This is based off of [Monokai Pro theme](https://monokai.pro/). I'm also using [JetBrains Mono Typeface w/Ligatures](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

note: I did not tweak the 3d editor settings since I mostly work in 2d.

## Installation

Currently, custom theme is not working for me but I have provided a theme.tres which should be the only changes needed. Otherwise just replace my `editor_settings-4.tres` with yours and make sure to replace the font setting with where your custom font lives, if you're using it. If you're not using it then you can delete that line.

On MacOS the file lives:

 ```{user}/Library/Application Support/Godot```
